# Creating Customer Segments Project for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Project overview

In this project I analyze data containing various costomers' annual spending amounts on different product categories to get insight into how to best structure distributors delivery service. For this I am using different **Machine Learning** concepts:

* Feature scaling
* Outlier detection
* Dimensionality reduction using **Principle Component Analysis**
* Unsupervised learning algorithms like **K-Means Clustering** and **Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering**
* **Silhouette coefficient** for clustering

## Prerequisites

The code is **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and it uses:

* [SciKit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can install everything you need to run this project with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Installing
Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/rauf-mifteev/MLND_Customer_Segments.git`

## Run the Code
Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with costomer_segments.ipynb:

`jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb`
